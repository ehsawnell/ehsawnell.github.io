                  <p>
                    The first flip of life happens when my parents decide to leave separated, 
                    It was a sign of life that told me be ready Ehsan you are going to pass your first life exam.
                    That was easy because I have a woman in my back that be my mother and father at the same time, 
                    She supported me as well as she can, she grow me up in the best way that a parents can and I owe her my life. 
                    <br/>Thanks Mom.

                  <h3>Big Chance!</h3>
                  <p>
                    In life, if God takes something from you, gives you something, or someone better and stronger, 
                    someone who shows the way, can be a friend or a family member or a stranger, he was my uncle to me.
                    That changed the shape of my life with his decisions
                    The main idea of my life was formed in his hand, the first movements and many things that I experienced with his hand,
                    the reason for my success is all his kindness and efforts. <br/>
                    I hope one day I can repay his favors.

                <h3>Best change of my life</h3>
                <p>
                  When I talk about the best change, it's not just about moving from one city to another, 
                  it's all about lifestyle, thinking, behavior, culture and so on.
                  It was easy to get used to the culture of the people because it is 
                  very close to my country and we have a culture close to Cyprus, but 
                  the way people dress, the language that people speak to each other 
                  and being alone abroad was all new. on other hand I was a person who 
                  Grew up in a Islamic country with a limited thinking power , from a small 
                  town that people can judge each other by their dressing style.
                  Imagine you are a coil that was under pressure from government and peoples 
                  thinking style that pressures power make your jump higher and higher , when 
                  the coil release, I felt free.
                  when you cant have an option in your life as your basic rights 
                  you can enjoy more than others when you get it.
                  I was like a seagull that reach the sea for first time after live at desert  
                  from beginning of the life all the experiments had another taste even if I had 
                  it before, I was like a child that can walk for first time because  the style that I walk before was totally wrong, I saw life from a whole that limited to see parts that putted beside each other for involve peoples mind.
                  


                </p>
                <p>
                  finally I changed myself to be able for see life from all the peoples eyes, we 
                  think we are right because we watch problem from our side and I got this point 
                  when I came to Cyprus.
                  University life was interesting and amazing for me, I learned how to live, more 
                  than academic courses and this was my life's biggest change.
                </p>
                <h3>What is next ?</h3>
                <p>
                  At this moment that I am writing this sentences, I already finished trading by price 
                  action method, Html & CSS and JS, Adobe illustrator, photoshop and I am going to 
                  finish flutter & Dart course beside learning Russian language.
                  after one and half year my first university  period will finish and 
                   we will go to the next part of life by higher plans and programs.<br />
                  Good luck to me :)
